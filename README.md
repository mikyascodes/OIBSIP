The calculator includes basic operations as well as advanced functions such as logarithmic and trigonometric functionalities. It has both day and night modes, allowing the user to switch between modes. Additionally, by hitting the settings button, a user can switch between different button configurations on the calculator.

### Task 3 ‚úÖ
In this task I built a todo app using HTML, Bootstrap(CSS) for frontend and I used Django for backend. The website allows user to create a task. They can see the task in the pending section of the webpage until they complete it. If they mark the task as complete the task will be moved from pending section of the page to completed section. It also allows users to Edit or Delete the task.<br/><br/>

### Task 4 ‚úÖ
In this last task, we were tasked with implementing a simple user authentication system using a programming language of our choice, I used Django(Python). The system allows users to register by providing information that will be displayed on their profile. After registration, users can log in and access their profile page. The Django app includes:
<ul>
<li>Validation to prevent multiple users from registering with the same username or email.</li>
<li>Validation errors for incorrect login credentials.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
