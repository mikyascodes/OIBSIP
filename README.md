### Task 1
For this task, I built a JavaScript calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator includes basic operations as well as advanced functions such as logarithmic and trigonometric functionalities. It has both day and night modes, allowing the user to switch between modes. Additionally, by hitting the settings button, a user can switch between different button configurations on the calculator. The layout was primarily created using Bootstrap.
